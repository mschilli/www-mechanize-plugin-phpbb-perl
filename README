NAME
    WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::phpBB - Screen scraper for phpBB installations

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable;
        use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
        Log::Log4perl->easy_init($DEBUG);

        my $mech = new WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable;

        $mech->get("http://some.forum.site.com/forum");
        $mech->phpbb_login("username", "password");

            # Get a list of forums
        my $forums = $mech->phpbb_forums();
        for my $forum (@$forums) {
            print "Forum:", $forum->text(), "\n";
        }

            # Enter a forum matched by a regex
        $mech->phpbb_forum_enter(qr(^The Forum Name$));

            # Return a list of topics
        my $topics = $mech->phpbb_topics();
        for my $topic (@$topics) {
            print "headline=$topic->{text} url=$topic->{url}\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a screen scraper for phpBB installations. It can log in to a
    phpBB web interface, and pull forum and topics names.

    It is implemented as a plugin to WWW::Mechanize, using Joe McMahon's
    WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable framework.

    $mech->phpbb_login($user, $passwd)
        Log into the phpBB web interface using the given credentials. It
        requires that the $mech object currently points to a phpBB page
        showing a "Login" link.

        Returns "undef" if the login fails and fires a Log4perl message at
        level ERROR.

    my $forums = $mech->phpbb_forums()
        If the $mech object points to a forum site's overview page listing
        the forums, phpbb_forums will return a ref to an array of forums.
        Every element of the array is a WWW::Mechanize::Link object and
        therefore has the methods "text()" and "url" to show forum name and
        the forum url:

                # Get a list of forums
            my $forums = $mech->phpbb_forums();
            for my $forum (@$forums) {
                print "Forum:", $forum->text(), " ", $forum->url(), "\n";
            }

    $mech->phpbb_forum_enter($regex)
        If the $mech object points to a forum site's overview page listing
        the forums, "phpbb_forum_enter" will have the WWW::Mechanize object
        enter the first forum matching the specified regex:

                # Enter a forum matched by a regex
            $mech->phpbb_forum_enter(qr(^The Forum Name$));

        Returns 1 on success and undef on failure.

    my $topics = $mech->phpbb_topics()
        If the $mech object points to a forum page listing the topics,
        "phpbb_topics" will scrape the topics off that page (which might
        only be a fraction of the topics available for the given forum):

                # Return a list of topics
            my $topics = $mech->phpbb_topics();
            for my $topic (@$topics) {
                print "headline=$topic->{text} url=$topic->{url}\n";
            }

        Every element of the array ref returned is a hashref, containing
        values for the keys "text" (topic headline), "url" (url to the first
        page showing this topic), "count" (number of postings for this
        topic).
